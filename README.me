The most challenging part of this application was transferring from mongoDB to dynamoDB and dealing with asynchronous execution when implementing parameter store. 
I used Stack Overflow frequently, some ChatGPT, and tried to make use of my classmates as a resource. I enjoyed figuring out the structure of the application. 

I was unable to fully implement Kubernetes and Parameter Store, but incomplete parts of both exist in my application and were highlighted in the video.
